- I have used most popular dataset i.e, iris dataset for binary classification. In this project I have used two labels, which are two flowers, namely - Iris-versicolor and Iris-setosa In the below step I have carried out the basic Machine Learning lifecycle where the aim is to use the dataset, create a Machine Learning model and finding its accuracy.
